        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <pre>
            He is a hustler, he's no good at all
            He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
            He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
            He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun

            I know you told me I should stay away
            I know you said he's just a dog astray
            He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
            And even I know this ain't smart

            But mama I'm in love with a criminal
            And this type of love isn't rational
            It's physical
            Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
            All reasons aside, I just can't deny
            Love the guy

            He is a villain by the devil's law
            He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
            That man's a snitch and unpredictable
            He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none

            Oh, I know should let go, but no
            'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
            And even I know this ain't smart

            But mama I'm in love with a criminal
            And this type of love isn't rational
            It's physical
            Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
            All reasons aside, I just can't deny
            Love the guy

            And he's got my name
            Tattooed on his arm
            His lucky charm
            So I guess it's okay
            He's with me

            And I hear people talk
            Try to make remarks
            Keep us apart
            But I don't even hear
            I don't care

            'Cause mama I'm in love with a criminal
            And this type of love isn't rational
            It's physical
            Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
            All reasons aside, I just can't deny
            Love the guy

            Mama I'm in love with a criminal
            And this type of love isn't rational
            It's physical
            Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
            All reasons aside, I just can't deny
            Love the guy
